### Point d
1. In the first convolution, in the first 1D Gaussian filter it applies it first on $x$ direction and then on the $y$ direction. That double operation is equivalent to a 2D Gaussian filter. With that filter combination gives us the possibility to apply a smooth on image.
In our example we get a smoothed white point which reflects the bell-shaped fuction viewed from above. Hence applying the first convolution on the rows of the image we get black rows, apart the central row which get smoothed. In the second convolution the central row is smoothed in vertical, propagating the white pixels through all the image obtaining a radial view.
2. As for the mechanism explained above, filter.py applies first a normal Gaussian convolution parallel to the horizontal axes, but now the second convolution is the derivative $Dx$ of the Gaussian filter. The derivative filter array has, in the first half, values tending to 1, while in the second half the values tend to 0. This means that applying the filter in vertical ($Dx.T$) the upper part of the image is lighter, while the bottom part is darker.
3. Now the convolution is first applied with $Dx.T$ and then with $Gx$. The resulting image is the same as the second point, this means that the order in which the convolution is applied doesn't matter. Hence it seems that the convolution is commutative. The transformation could be different if the direction in which we apply the kernels changes, like for example ```conv(conv(img, Gx.T), Dx)``` (point 5 and 6).
4. Here the system apply both the convolution with a kernel obtained by the derivative function $Dx$. The first convolution is applied horizontally and we get an image where the first half is white and the second one is darker. The transpose kernel has the brighter pixels in the upper part of the array, while the darker ones in the bottom part.
Applying the filter vertically, in the first half the brighter pixels are brought in the first quadrant and the darker ones in the third quadrant because it is applied on the white ones. In the second half the pixels are brought to the second quadrant because it is applied on the darker ones.
